# odd-even-linked-list
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

### Example 1
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

### Constraints:
* n == number of nodes in the linked list
* 0 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* -10<sup>6</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>6</sup>
